# MartianTools
A Staff Management plugin

## WARNING THIS IS STILL NOT FULLY DEVELOPED.

## KNOWN BUGS
* Remove Warning Command crash

## TODO
- [ ] Fix Remove Warning Command
- [ ] Add More Warning Commands
- [ ] Add Report Manager
- [ ] Add Report Commands
- [ ] Add Mute Manager
- [ ] Add Mute Commands
- [ ] Add Kick Manager
- [ ] Add Kick Commands
- [ ] Add Staff Chat
- [ ] Add Alerts (`/alert <message>`, will send a message to all the staff incase of something important.)
- [ ] Discord Integration for staff alerts and staff chat
- [ ] Player Information and Tracking 
  * `/check [player]` - Displays information such as playtime, last login and ip, as form contents, and 2 buttons to view their current inventory, and their ender chest. (Vault integration?)
  * `/checkalts <player>` - Log all accounts logged in from the same IP
- [ ] Freeze System
- [ ] Central Punishment System
  * `/punish [player] [type] [time] [reason]` - Central command to issue a punishment (mute, ban, kick, warn) based on predefined types. Automated escalations based on previous warnings or infractions, the system could automatically apply more severe punishments for repeated offenses.
GUI for punishments will add a simple GUI for easier punishment handling (e.g., buttons for mute, ban, etc.). (a way to toggle between forms / chestgui for those who prefer either one i have a system for that..
- [ ] Audit Logs
- [ ] Keeping Records
  * `/log [player]` – Allows staff to view a player’s full interaction history with staff, including any reports, punishments, or warnings issued.'
- [ ] (Tentative) Broadcast Command (Broadcast a message to all players i think pm does this but idk if its good?)
- [ ] (Tentative) (Toggable) Announcer System (since my other plugin was on my hacked / deleted GH account, i could potentionally intgrate it but poggit likes things seperated)
